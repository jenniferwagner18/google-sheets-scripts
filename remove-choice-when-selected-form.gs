/*
This function is used to update multiple choice options on a Form. It can be used by 
students for signing up for presentations. 

The following Sheet includes this code, but you will need to add a trigger:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dRU4dnsazVqqNbWVr14kUb1QfuaXpLJUjVY4txELzdQ/copy?usp=sharing

To add a trigger in Sheets, go to Extensions -> Apps Script -> Trigger (left sidebar): 
+ Add Trigger with On form submit under Select event type (leave the rest as they are)

On the spreadsheet, go to Tools and Create a Form to link the Sheet and Form. The Options 
listed on the Sheet should be entered into your Form as the multiple choice question 
options. Copy and paste the full URL of the form on the Config sheet. You may also need to 
update the formula in the C column on Options, depending on what the name of the Form responses 
sheet will be. (It's usually Form Responses and a number.)

On the Form, change the settings to "Collect email adressses" as well as "Limit to 
1 response" and "Edit after submit" if you want your students to be able to change 
their responses. Their original choice will then be placed back into the Form for 
another student to select.
