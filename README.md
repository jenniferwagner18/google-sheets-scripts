# Google Scripts
Google Scripts for automating tasks in Sheets and creating Forms from Sheets. Mostly designed for instructors to use with students. Copy and paste the code into Extensions -> Apps Script after creating your Sheet and click Save. Scripts will run directly in Sheets when editing a cell or a new menu item will be added after Help. Remove Choices on a Form is slightly more complicated to set up (follow directions in the code file).
